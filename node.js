//to make a project of Node.js follow the steps--------------------

// 1. make a project folder.
// 2. open in vs code
// 3. make entry file with index.js
// 4. install package.json with "npm init" in terminal
// 5.install node modules with "npm install" in terminal
// 6. add gitignone file in the project.
// 7. add dependencies as required and add modules and other files as required.
