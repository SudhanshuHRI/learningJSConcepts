// * 2 type of data staructure :-
// 1.linear data structure = array, stack, queue
// 2.Non-linear data staructures= tree, graph

// * Array Traversing = to check each element in array
// * Array Accessing = to get a specific element from array
// * Algorithm = steps to do any task in program.
// * Algorithm complexity = 1.time complexity, 2. space complexity
// 1. Time complexity = it is calculated by counting the number of steps to finish the execution. if a program have 50 lines of code then time complexity will be 50 but if we have loop who excutes 100 times in 50 lines then time complexity will be 150.
// 2.Space complexity = space required to excute the program + space complexity = Auxilary space / supportive space + input size / variable space. if a program needs 1 MB to excute program, then Space complexity will be 1 MB.
// * To do a task there is multiple algorithm / multiple ways.
// * Big-O-Notation = it is a unit to denote complexity. eg- weight's Big-O-Notation is "kg"
// * which algorithm we have to choose, it depends on data size. choosing wrong algorithm will increase complexity. That is why we have multiple algirithm to do single task.
// * Asymptotic analysis = tells which algorithm is best for doing that single task. In Asymptotic analysis we use different notations to find the best algorithm . time and space complexity is also calculated in asymptotic analysis. also in time and space complexity, time complexity is important to measure because using large running loops will increase time complexity. eg- if we have array of 100 elements and we have to search element then linear search algorithm is best but if we have 1000000 elements the binary search will be best for searching.
// * Asymptotic Notation = we have 3 notations. big-O-notation, omega notation, theta notation.
// * Time complexity directly depends on input. eg- if we use nested loops , and we have 6 elements array then loop will run 6*6=36 times. so time complexity depends upon inputs.
// * input is chuncks of data where algorithm is going to implement. eg- [1,2,3,4,5] in this it's elements are chunks and each element is called input.
// f(N) = 5N*5N + 6N + 12. This formula is used to find time complexity where nested loops are used. here N = no of elements in Array.
// f(N) = 6N + 12. This formula is used to find time complexity with no nested loops. here N = no of elements in Array.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  Sorting  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// * loop will always excute (arraylength * arraylength) times maximum to sort an array. if we have some elements that are sorted already, then no of excution will decrease.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Recurtion  ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// * recurtion = a function that calls itself + it have 2 types-
// 1.direct/basice recurtion = it is default recurion
// 2. indirect recurtion = 2 functions that calls themselfs and stops on a perticular conditions.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Stack ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// * In stack data structure, elements are added / removed / updated from a single end + in array we do same where we want like adding element in first or last or in middle of array but in stack we can do it with single end.
// * It works on Last in first out (LIFO) . means last item added to stack is the first one to be removed.
// * we decalre maximum value of stack. eg- we have to declare stack will be of 10 element so only 10 elements will be enter.
//* key operations in stack = push, pop , peek(view the top elememt) , isEmpty(checks if stack is empty)
//* Stack is used when you need to maintain history of operations. Stack is used in browser history naivgation, undo functionallity etc
//* Stack is not required if you want to access random elements

let stack = [];
let data = "Hello World";

const push = ()=>{}
const pop = ()=>{}
